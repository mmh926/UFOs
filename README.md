## Overview of the analysis:
Build dynamic webpage to accept user inputs and adjust accordingly to reflect interaction. 

   o The purpose is to create a dynamic webpage that I will build by inserting JavaScript into an HTML page. I will also utilize CSS and Bootstrap, to    build and style the web page while exploring Chrome div tools to test my code, as I go.  I will produce a result that is visually appealing and      interactive, with an attention-grabbing header.

## Results:
  o	To perform a search, start by utilizing one or all the filter criteria’s: Enter Date, Enter City, Enter State, Enter County, and/or Enter Shape (see image below), following the examples provided in the white boxes.

  o	After you select the Filter Table” button, the web page table will populate by activating the code I wrote, storing the values in the text box and id’s associated with the text box in a JavaScript object. For example, if you type in “ak” for Arkansas, in the “Enter State” filter box, UFO sightings that occurred in that state will populate the table (see below) and in the background (Chrome div tools console) the JavaScript code will store the value in the text box and the id’s associated with the text box in the JavaScript object and show the element value in the console. 
  (The screenprint below shows an example of a state filter output.)

  (The below screen print shows a circle shape filter output.)

  o	This tool is interactive, so have fun with it!
  
  
  
## Summary:
  o	In summary, the webpage output is eye catching, interactive, and informative. However, the drawbacks to this page are, there are no dropdown button options, you have to manually unfilter the table and the filter automatically updates after you type a valid code into the filter box then click into another box.
